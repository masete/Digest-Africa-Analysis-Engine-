            <h3>Despite Covid19, 2020 was still a good year to raise funding</h3>
            <h6>The second half of 2020 saw more funding raised by African startup companies compared to the first half
                of 2020 (6.2%). Companies raised $440M across 189 rounds compared to $414M across 172 deals of H1 2020,
                an increase in funding of $26M. The month that recorded the highest number of deals was September 2020
                with 69 deals that had a value of  $161.7M which is a significant uptick from September 2019 that
                recorded $30M across 36 rounds. The effects of the COVID-19 global pandemic had caused a drop in
                the funding for startups on the continent in the first half the year, but as business slowly returned,
                the funding gradually increased. Due to the lockdowns that were instituted to combat the COVID-19 in
                the second quarter of 2020, there was an expected dip in funding as cautious investors, in the face of
                economic uncertainty, continued to fund existing portfolio companies and/or sectors that were able to
                weather the COVID-19 effects. With lockdowns easing and business resuming, there was an attendant
                increase in funding in H2 which even saw some exits. This added to the continuing news of exits for the
                African ecosystem that have made headlines over the course of 2020. This has included the $288 million
                purchase of DPO Group, a payments services provider for African businesses, by Network International
                and Stripe’s $200M acquisition of Nigeria’s
                Paystack.<br><br>
